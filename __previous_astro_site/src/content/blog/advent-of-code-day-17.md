Hey guys...

So, today's one (as well as yesterday's) were especially hard. Long story short, I'm not doing today's advent of code.

(P.S., I also only got through part 1 of day 16's puzzles, which also is disappointing for me.)

I feel pretty down about this, because this type of thing is not my strong suit (at least, tetris-style programming isn't my strong suit).

Maybe I'll come back and do this one, maybe not. Who knows?

I'll try to stay positive and attempt the next days' puzzles, but this may be the end.

I guess completing this year fully won't happen :/
