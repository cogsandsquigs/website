Anyways, I'm a little late to the news, but here's the gist: we now have a list of all employees at DOGE *and their emails*. This comes as part of a FOIA request (link [here](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-02-20.%20GEC%20to%20Trump%20re%20Musk%20Role%20DOGE.pdf), archives: [1](https://web.archive.org/web/20250308064307/https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-02-20.%20GEC%20to%20Trump%20re%20Musk%20Role%20DOGE.pdf)) by Alejandra Caraballo (link [here](https://bsky.app/profile/esqueer.net/post/3ljpyyjzfis2l), archives: [1](https://archive.ph/WncdB)).

To do my part as a good and patriotic citizen of my country, I am hereby putting in the effort to clean up and re-format the data into a more accessable format, easily converted into CSV or whatever data format you desire, for all your data needs.

Of course, don't do anything stupid now! You wouldn't want the "gOvErNmEnT" to get a widdle angwy at you ;).

Have fun!
