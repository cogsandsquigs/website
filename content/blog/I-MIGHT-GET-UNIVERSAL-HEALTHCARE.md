Holy shit!

I might get actual, universal healthcare! (at least in the state of Illinois, USA)

Ok, well, it probably (let's be honest) won't pass. Or, that's what I'm thinking. I'm worried that too many people will just not pass it. Like how Illinois *still* doesn't have a progressive income tax (just a flat one). BUT STILL. It's Huge !!!

The link for the actual law is [here](https://ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=3780\&GAID=18\&GA=104\&DocTypeID=HB\&LegID=162649\&SessionID=114#) ([full text](https://ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=\&SessionId=114\&GA=104\&DocTypeId=HB\&DocNum=3780\&GAID=18\&LegID=162649\&SpecSess=\&Session=)/[pdf](https://ilga.gov/legislation/104/HB/PDF/10400HB3780lv.pdf), archives: [1](https://web.archive.org/web/20250305213430/https://ilga.gov/legislation/104/HB/PDF/10400HB3780lv.pdf), [2](https://archive.ph/FvYIo)).

I think one of my favorite parts (besides, yaknow, the universal healthcare) is the fact that it outlaws private investment-ownership of healthcare services. This means no more private equity in hospitals! No more firing nurses for "efficiency" and "cutting costs"! No more shady under-the-table deals between private equity firms and insurance providers and pharmacy benefit managers!

From the law:

> Section 5. Purposes. It is the purpose of this Act to provide universal access to health care for all individuals within the State, to promote and improve the health of all its citizens, to stress the importance of good public health through treatment and prevention of diseases, and to contain costs to make the delivery of this care affordable. Should legislation of this kind be enacted on a federal level, it is the intent of this Act to become a part of a nationwide system.

I know that good things feel impossible right now, and that I think that it's pretty reasonable to not believe in government right now. But maybe, just maybe, something good can happen. I hope that the people in power do the right thing. I hope that something, anything, good happens.

I kinda need it right now.
