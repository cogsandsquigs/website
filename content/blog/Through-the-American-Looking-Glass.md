*Heads up! This is basically just a ramble.*

Well, I mean. If I were to describe it in the shortest possible way, it would be:

> "AAUGGHGGAAAUGHGUAGUG" *relentless sobbing*

On a more serious note, I really just feel... bad. Just bad. Really bad, almost all the time. Its essentially just a dull, numbing-yet-painful ice-pick-through-the-orbital-bone type dread that I feel daily.

There's a really evil part of me that says feeling bad isn't allowed because I'm American and I "deserve it", but that's kinda illogical. I suffer, regardless of what happens or who does it to me. It turns out that my suffering, however, is government-inflicted.

Was I expecting this? Sort-of. Did I think it would be this bad? No.
