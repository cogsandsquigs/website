*Heads up! This is basically just a ramble.*

Well, I mean. If I were to describe it in the shortest possible way, it would be:

> "AAUGGHGGAAAUGHGUAGUG" *relentless sobbing*

On a more serious note, I really just feel... bad. Just bad. Really bad, almost all the time. It's essentially just a dull, numbing-yet-painful ice-pick-through-the-orbital-bone type dread that I feel daily.

There's a really evil part of me that says feeling bad isn't allowed because I'm American and I "deserve it", but that's kinda illogical. I suffer, regardless of what happens or who does it to me. It turns out that my suffering, however, is government-inflicted.

Was I expecting this? Sort-of. Did I think it would be this bad? No.

I'm genuinely worried, however, that people will think that Americans are all, like, for this? I'm not really sure, but online at least (where we all know people have sensible opinions) it seems that some think that it's what "we deserve". There's a larger faction who think that we're just apathetic to the situation and won't do anything, which is entirely untrue --- at least from my perspective.

So many people care. I just don't think some others understand.

So, I want to say: I care. A lot, in fact. I know family and friends who could be targeted under this regime (myself included, possibly!). I'm really scared about my future, especially because I essentially don't have one. Sure, I may exist into the future, but I have no real plans for what happens next. I'm just taking every day as-is, because tomorrow could always get worse, and it doesn't look like it's getting better anytime soon.

I think that, if at least one person is scared, and cares a lot, then maybe that means a lot of other people are. The Copernican principle says that nothing is special, so if I feel this, then more people do too. And I think that that matters.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this really. I just need to put this out somewhere. Anywhere.

There's a lot of scared people here right now.

I'm just glad Uncle Seth isn't here to see AIDS funding being stripped away.
