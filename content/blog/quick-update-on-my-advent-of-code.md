title: Quick update on my Advent of Code
draft: false
---

Hey everybody!

So, quick update: I've decided that my [Advent of Code repo](https://github.com/cogsandsquigs/advent-of-code-2022) isn't gonna be some static monument to all the stuff that I wrote.

Instead, it'll change. Not by much, but if I find some implementation that is cooler, or if I find a way to optimize it, or some other thing or doodad that I can tweak, then I'll go ahead and tweak it.

This is mainly for me to just play around with, and not much else. I don't have any reason to keep it static, and I despise ugly code, so why not change it? Plus, it's a learning experience for me (and maybe you too!), and making things better is all part of the fun.

In other news, I'm still doing the AoC puzzles, if anyone's wondering. It usually takes me an hour or two from the time they get released. Yes, I do wake up in the middle of night to do this. Yes, I know that it isn't the healthiest thing to do. No, I won't stop this.

The main motivator for this behavior is that my ranking on the AoC website is steadily increasing. I haven't gotten any points yet, but I have climbed from somewhere like 7000th place to 3000th. And that makes me feel good! So on we adventure into the late night, with nothing but puzzles, a computer, a water bottle, and some chapstick.

Anyways, that's all for now. So, in the meantime, I hope anyone who's here has a nice day, and thanks for reading!

(P.S.: If you want a more detailed/comprehensive overview of the Advent of Code, I recommend looking at [FasterThanLime's series on it](https://fasterthanli.me/series/advent-of-code-2022). It's really cool, and he does a lot of interesting, wacky and sometimes insane stuff with rust. Check him out!)
