Aaaand i'm back!

Sorry for the delay, as I've been really tired due to a lot of holiday planning stuff + AoC screwing with my sleep schedule a _lot_. Suffice to say, I feel pretty OK.

As a general status update, I was able to keep up with the AoC for a while before it got too difficult/time-consuming for me to pursue, leading me to complete days 18, 20, and 21. This leaves 6 uncompleted, which I think is OK.

All in all, I feel meh about this. I should have done better (maybe one or two more?), but I was getting really tired (aforementioned issues), and it was imparing my progress. Also, I was just getting fed up with it :p.

I think I'll take a break from my projects and inner musings now, at least for a short while. Once I get back into the swing of things, then I'll hopefully start programming more again.
